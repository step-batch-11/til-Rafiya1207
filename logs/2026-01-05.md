# Topics Covered In Session

- Readable stream
- writable stream
- pipeTo
- pipeThrough
- TransformStream
- TextEncoder, TextDecoder
- for await

# Confusing

- prompt mechanism
- TransformStream
- Degrees, Radians, sin
- perlin noise calculation (algorithm)

# Questions

- how does pipeThrough work?
- how different pipeThrough is from pipeTo?
- what is degree in a circle?
- what is radian in a circle?

# Things To Explore/Try

- Transition chunk in PNG
- if circle is divided into 360 parts and one part of is considered as degree,
  try representing the degree.
- try adjusting the size of image got.

# Learnings Of The Day

- Don't attack at whole problem.
- Have a system to solve the problem.
- Abstract things.
- image generation
  - To prevent the image array from being misinterpreted as ASCII characters, we
  must map the values to Base64.
  - _G means kitty graphics protocol and ghostty uses kitty protocol.
  - f=100 means PNG format
  - a=T means transmit and display
- perlin noise 
  - is smooth random whose value is close to previously generated value.
  - algorithm was developed for marble like texture in graphics.
- p5js
  - point
  - sin, cos
  - floor
  - line
  - if background is kept in draw function, then it gets painted on each iteration newly.
  - p5js functions are specific to setup and draw functions only.
  - better understanding of x and y axis of the canvas.
  - width, height
  - setup and draw functions are called at the end.


# What Have I Done Today

- learnt about image parsing on terminal
- Random Walker
- sine wave
- cos Wave 
- watched video about perlin noise
- drew circle using sin and cos

# Things To Do Tomorrow
- study about pipe through
- make theory about working of prompt and validate
- read about degree, radian
- search for the applications of sin and cos

> Today was useful because **I wrestled with sin and cos**.
