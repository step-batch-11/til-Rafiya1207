# Topics Covered In Session

- tokei
- coverage
- injecting dependency
- parser
- inverse controlling
- converting file as stream
- structuring directory

# Confusing

# Questions

# Things To Explore/Try

- using generator for the head assignment.

# Learnings Of The Day

- checking shell's head's output with the head.
- tokei - for code lines count
- coverage - for checking how much code was covered by tests
- injecting dependency - if a function is dependent on some functionality ( or
  some other function ), pass that function as argument, making it independent.
- parser
  - it should take queue and return a structured object.
  - create a class scanner that has methods peek and consume.
- main.js shouldn't be tested

# What Have I Done Today

- implemented transformer for streams
- have a todos
- write a command that will strike through the completed task
- a program that will return pending tasks

# Things To Do Tomorrow

- modify the writer and pass to head
- structure the directory
- segregate the functions
- integrate the TransformStream into head
- make file as stream and transform

> Today was useful because **I myself figured out a way of transforming stream
> eventhough i had no clarity about it**.
